# House Hub audit, Phase 6: implementation record

One section per batch, in the order of the plan (`audits/05-findings.md`, "The plan"). Each section gives the change, the commit, the reruns of each finding's own reproduction, the capture-rig recapture against the Phase 1 baseline, the rubric rescore, the repo tests, and what was not verified (constitution, Phase 6). The status of every finding is carried into `audits/05-findings.md` from `audits/tools/phase6/status.mjs` by `node audits/tools/phase5/build-findings.mjs`.

Nothing is pushed: the batches sit on `main` locally until the household says to deploy, so none of them is live on https://vantrix117.github.io/house-hub/ yet.

## Batch 0a — The hub boots with Reduce Motion on

| | |
|---|---|
| **Findings** | P2-STAB-01 (critical) and its pointer P2-VIS-01: both FIXED |
| **Code commit** | `ae274a6` (2026-09-26) |
| **Files** | `apps/hub.js:442` (one line added), `index.html:662` (one line changed), `sw.js` (VERSION `hub-v27` → `hub-v28` by `node scripts/bump-sw.mjs`, so installed PWAs pick up the new shell) |
| **Schema / data** | None. No backup was needed; the production database was not touched. |

### The change

Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, hub.js left its sheen block before it defined `hub.sheenFrom`, and the shell's boot called `hub.sheenFrom(views)` unguarded, so the boot threw and every device with Reduce Motion on showed a blank page, the pairing screen included (`audits/02-shell.md:3097`).

- `apps/hub.js:442`: `hub.sheenFrom = () => {};` now runs first in the sheen block, before the reduced-motion return. With motion allowed, line 448 replaces it with the real function exactly as before.
- `index.html:662`: `if (typeof hub.sheenFrom === 'function') hub.sheenFrom(views);`, so an older cached hub.js cannot blank the shell either.

### Each finding's reproduction, rerun

The baseline evidence in `audits/evidence/p2/` is left as it was (the scripts write there; their outputs were moved to `audits/evidence/p6/0a/` and the Phase 2 files restored).

| Script | Before (Phase 2) | After |
|---|---|---|
| `node audits/tools/phase2/STAB/reduced-motion.mjs` | reduce: `shellHidden=true`, gate hidden, `sheenFrom` undefined, a TypeError, on iPad, TV and iPhone | reduce: iPad (Eli) and TV (kiosk) show the shell, iPhone (signed out) shows the picker; `sheenFrom=function`, 0 errors, all 6 cases → `audits/evidence/p6/0a/STAB/reduced-motion.json` |
| `node audits/tools/phase2/VIS/verify-reduced-motion-blank-shell-2.mjs` (the batch's named check) | all 7 cases with the setting on at load were blank (shell and gate both hidden, one `TypeError: hub.sheenFrom is not a function` each); the setting switched on after load, Tally on its own and the controls were fine | all 11 cases boot: WebKit iPad/iPhone Eli, Ezra (kid), TV kiosk → shell shown; signed out and unpaired iPad → gate shown with the picker / pairing form; Reduce Motion switched on after load; Tally opened on its own; Chromium desktop, reduce and control; 0 page errors in any → `audits/evidence/p6/0a/VIS/verify-rm2.json` |
| `node audits/tools/phase2/VIS/density-motion.mjs` (last block) | `Reduce Motion reduce: shellHidden true` | `{"gateHidden":true,"shellHidden":false,"sheenFrom":"function","matches":true,"errors":[]}` → `audits/evidence/p6/0a/VIS/density-motion.json`; the density figures above it are unchanged |

After-screenshots: `audits/evidence/p6/0a/VIS/verify-rm2-webkit-iphone-eli-reduce.png` (Home on the iPhone), `verify-rm2-webkit-ipad-unpaired-reduce.png` (the pairing form), `verify-rm2-webkit-tv-kiosk-reduce.png` (the TV board), `verify-rm2-webkit-ipad-ezra-reduce.png` (kid Home), and the rest of `audits/evidence/p6/0a/`.

**Same page with the setting on or off.** `node audits/tools/lib/pxdiff.mjs` over four pairs of after-screenshots (Reduce Motion off vs on: the STAB iPad pair, the skeptic's WebKit iPad and Chromium desktop pairs, the density iPad pair): 4 compared, 0 changed beyond tolerance 48. The only difference the setting makes now is the sheen that no longer drifts, which the tolerance absorbs.

### Capture rig

hub.js and index.html load on every screen, so the whole matrix was recaptured: `node audits/tools/capture.mjs --out audits/screens-after/0a` → 4447 ok, 0 failed (`audits/screens-after/0a/manifest.json`; the PNGs are git-ignored like the baseline's).

- **Against the Phase 1 baseline** (`audits/screens/`): 4302 of 4447 byte-identical (`lib/compare.mjs`); `lib/pxdiff.mjs` finds 71 changed beyond tolerance 48, 34 of them under 200 pixels (`audits/evidence/p6/0a/capture/compare-baseline-after.txt`, `pxdiff-baseline-after.txt`).
- **Why none of the 71 comes from this batch.** The rig renders with `reducedMotion: 'no-preference'` (`audits/tools/lib/devices.mjs:33`), and on that path the batch changes nothing that runs: `hub.sheenFrom` is set to a no-op and then, as before, to the real function, and the new guard at `index.html:662` is always true. To test it, the 452 captures of the 7 areas' screens behind the 71 (28 screen-states, every state, device and mode) were taken again with the fix stashed, the pre-batch code (`audits/screens-after/0a-control/`). That control differs from the baseline in 57 of 452 (`pxdiff-baseline-control.txt`) and from the fixed run in 39 (`pxdiff-control-after.txt`), on the same screens and with different files flipping each run. So these screens do not capture the same way twice, whatever the code. Of the 71, 48 also changed under the pre-batch code, and 18 more are other devices or modes of screens that flipped under it. The last 5 captures (2 screens) were taken a third time with the fix (`audits/screens-after/0a-repeat/`, `pxdiff-baseline-repeat.txt`): `shell/pin-create-typical` now matches the baseline, and `prayer/today-lower-overflow` is the same list scrolled 25 px further, the same scroll-settling flake as Prayer's other overflow screens.
- **What the flakes are**, from the images: Prayer's long pages (faces, record review, lower Today) captured at a different scroll offset; the pairing-form input with or without its focus ring (autofocus timing); F260's week-complete and reflections at a different moment of their entrance; the park map's search sheet mid-transition; a few pixels of text antialiasing. The rig is deterministic for 4302+ captures, not for these 28 screen-states; later batches should compare them against a second baseline run rather than read their diffs as changes.
- **Reduce Motion captures.** The rig has no Reduce Motion state, so the fixed screens themselves are shown by the reruns above, not by the rig.

### Rubric rescore

The Phase 2-4 rubric scores were taken with Reduce Motion off, the rig's default, so no captured score depended on this bug. With Reduce Motion on, the shell scored nothing before (a blank page, unusable on every device) and now renders the same as with it off (the pixel comparison above), so it takes the shell's existing scores (`audits/04-design-system.md`, scorecard: shell 4.1). No other score changes in this batch.

### Repo tests

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| `node scripts/test-design.mjs` (includes the reduced-motion case) | 49 passed, 0 failed |
| `node scripts/test-hub.mjs <local code>` against a fresh local D1 (schema + seed, a throwaway local pairing code) | 19 passed, 3 failed, **identical to the baseline**: the same test on the pre-batch code (HEAD `3cad8d8`, its own fresh D1) gives the same 19/3 line for line. The 3 failures predate this batch and are stale test expectations: `signed in as Niece` (the profile is now named Mea), `reminder shows on A at once` and the kiosk reminder wait that follows it. They are not fixed here; they belong with the shell's tests in batch 2a. |
| `node scripts/bump-sw.mjs --check` | 74 precached files present, 67 shipped files accounted for |

There is no build step (CLAUDE.md). The test runs overwrite tracked screenshots in `docs/screens/`; those were restored, so the batch commit carries none of them.

### Not verified

- **A real device with Reduce Motion on.** The fix was proved in Playwright WebKit and Chromium with `prefers-reduced-motion` emulated. It was not seen on the Kitchen iPad, an iPhone or the TV with the iOS setting on; that is a device check, and the fix does not depend on anything the emulation cannot show.
- **The live site.** Nothing is pushed, so production still has the bug until the household deploys. After a push, the service worker's new VERSION (`hub-v28`) is what makes an installed PWA fetch the fixed shell.
- **Other callers.** `hub.sheenFrom` has no other callers in the repo (`index.html:662` is the only one outside hub.js), so nothing else needed the guard. The Dollywood exports were not rebuilt and do not call it.
